# TODO in the __getitem__ we search across the list of relations.. isn't it better to do that in advance? i.e.
#  building a search tree one time or something like that?

# TODO also in __getitem__, some MID are missing in the trainset under train.
#  for example: F0129/MID1/ is in the relations but not in the train-folder!!

# TODO normalize data. notice that we have both black&white images and color ones! pre-process?

# TODO add sigmoid to nn output

# TODO change to ResNet arch?

# TODO initialize NN properly
